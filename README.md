# Mark-Master
A module that allows you to mark people through proxy channel instead of having to select them and manually mark them.

Please note that you need to be party leader or raid leader for it to actually mark the player.

# Commands
* !mk mark name color    - To mark a player with desired color.

Example: !mk mark Icy 1 - to give player "Icy" a yellow mark.
 0 = red, 1 = yellow, 2 = blue
 
*  !mk rmall             - To remove all marks.

*  !mk remark            - To remark all players who have been marked before using the mark command.

*  !mk markme            - To mark yourself.

# Known issues

- Marking a player twice with different colors will give them two marks instead of removing the previous mark then adding the new one.
- Does not support removing a mark from a certain player....yet.
